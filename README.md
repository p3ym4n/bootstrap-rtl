# bootstrap-rtl
Right to Left (RTL) version of twitter's bootstrap html framework.

After checking all other RTL version's of bootstrap I figured that all of them have some issues .
like crashed carousel or right-navbar,left-navbar dropdown issues or popovers and tooltips wrong placements or even having a lot of un needed obsolete files of previous versions.
so this package should have only a modified version of bootstrap.css (also bootstrap.min.css) inside.
all other files are the same forked from the main bootstrap repository and you can use all these repository files instead of appending them after original bootstrap files.
