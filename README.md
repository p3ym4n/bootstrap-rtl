# bootstrap-rtl
Right to Left (RTL) version of twitter's bootstrap html framework.

After checking all other RTL version's of bootstrap i figured that all of them have some issues .
like crashed carousel or right navbar dropdown's or having a lot of un needed obselete files of previous versions.
so this package should have only a modified version of bootstrap.css (also bootstrap.min.css) inside.
all other file are the same forked from the main bootstrap repository.
